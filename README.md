Practice copy of https://html5up.net/paradigm-shift 

This was a fun little challenge to replicate. I felt like I did alright for the most part but looking at the original I still have a lot to learn when it comes to css and structuring html. Especially not using \<section> was a huge mistake (this is also the reason why I didn't manage to move the footer into the left part )
